# COMP558 Project
This project is based on the paper <b>Multi-orientation scene text detection with adaptive clustering from PAMI </b> by Xu-Cheng et al.

This is an implementation of a character detection part of the text detection algorithm for natural scenes where the texts are arbitrary put in any orientation.

This implementation includes the writing the MSER algorithm, which is the crux of the character detection, from a component tree. To generate this tree, a quasi-linear time algorithm based on the paper <b>Quasi-linear algorithm for the component tree</b> by L. Najman and M. Couprie
